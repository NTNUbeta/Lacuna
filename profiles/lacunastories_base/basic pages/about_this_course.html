<h2 style="text-align: center;">Sample Course Title</h2><h4 style="text-align: center;">University - Quarter/Semester, Year</h4><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Catalog Number</em>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Days, Start Time–End Time</em></p><h3>Course Description&nbsp;</h3><p>In this section, professors write a short description of their course, much like a syllabus course desciption or "about this course" section. For the purposes of this demo site, we have created a sample course about narratives surrounding human population - from scientific, to literary, to artistic representations. We hope this will make a nice array of materials to show the affordances of the Sewing Kit and Threads, which can help draw connections between texts. This should also make for an interesting Responses Map, a visuzalization that connects student writing to materials on the site, when the use the bibliography auto-fill feature in their Responses.</p><h3><strong>Student Success in this Course Will Include:</strong></h3><ol><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">&nbsp;Having fun looking around Lacuna Stories and seeing all it can do!</span></li><li>Trying out the Sewing Kit, creating threads, and writing a Response using the Bibliography auto-fill feature.</li></ol><h3>About the Instructors&nbsp;</h3><p>This is where an instructor\'s biography would normally go. Instead, I\'ll use this space to note that this demo site was put together by the co-director of Lacuna Stories, Brian Johnsrud. I am completing my PhD in Stanford University’s Modern Thought and Literature program. My current research interests include, broadly, cultural memory, media studies, medieval literature and the Crusades, the Middle East, the military, war and violence, performance, anthropology, cultural production and transmission. I am also interested in the digital humanities, and am the project manager for this very platform, Lacuna Stories!&nbsp;</p><h3>About the Teaching Assistant</h3><p>This is where a teaching assistant, or second instructor\'s, biography would normally go. Instead, I\'ll use this space to introduce the technical director of Lacuna Stories, Mike Widner.&nbsp;Mike Widner is the Academic Technology Specialist at Stanford’s Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages. His role is to work with faculty and their research assistants as a consultant, collaborator, and innovator in DLCL-based digital humanities and instructional technology projects. He also organizes and presents workshops and lectures on practices and theories in these fields.</p><p>Mike received his Ph.D. in the Department of English at the University of Texas at Austin. In his dissertation, "Genre Trouble: Embodied Cognition in Fabliaux, Gawain, and Bury St Edmunds," he uses cognitive science to argue for genre and embodiment as hermeneutic primitives. He traces variations in the representation of characters’ bodies in fabliau, romance, and chronicle, three of the most important and characteristic genres of medieval literature. While at UT, Widner was part of the Digital Writing and Research Lab, where he studied and taught new media, digital rhetorics and writing, and began mastering Drupal. He received an NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant to pursue work on Bibliopedia (http://www.bibliopedia.org), a Drupal-based system for the cross-referencing of humanities scholarship and the conversion of metadata into linked data. This system has been used by multiple groups at Stanford, including the Chinese Railroad Workers Project. Prior to entering graduate school, Widner was a UNIX Systems Administrator for SBC (now AT&amp;T), where he was responsible for a large range of servers, including those used to authenticate users connecting to the ISP. He programs in Python, Perl, PHP, shell, javascript, and C++. Other technologies he uses include Drupal, TEI, Gephi, d3, HTML/CSS, databases, Apache, Solr, and numerous others.</p>
