 * Allow book marking of Page Turner pages

/*
 * Plan: because flags are per-entity, but we can save values
 * use the values per entity, per user to store which page(s)
 * have been bookmarked and to remove those bookmarks, when needed
 * see: https://www.drupal.org/node/1748148#write-flagging-fields
 * Example of multiple bookmarked pages in one node:
 * $flagging->{'page'}['und'][0]['value'] = 1
 * $flagging->{'page'}['und'][1]['value'] = 7
